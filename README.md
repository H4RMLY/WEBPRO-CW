### Prompts to develop excersises and instructions (exmaple)
These are the prompts that helped me determine the excercises and instructions for them for the build your workout feature:

####  Prompt 1: Write a short description of an arm workout for a training app

#### Response:
Title: Sculpted Arms Workout

Description:
Get ready to tone and strengthen your arms with this intense workout designed to target all the major muscle groups in your upper body. This arm-focused routine incorporates a variety of exercises to challenge your biceps, triceps, shoulders, and forearms, leaving you with sculpted, defined arms.

Warm-Up:
Start with a quick warm-up to prepare your muscles for the workout ahead. Perform arm circles, shoulder rolls, and gentle stretches to loosen up.

Main Workout:

    Bicep Curls: Grab a pair of dumbbells and perform 3 sets of 12 reps of bicep curls, focusing on controlled movements and squeezing at the top of each repetition to engage the biceps.

    Tricep Dips: Find a stable surface like a bench or chair and perform 3 sets of 10-12 reps of tricep dips, lowering your body down until your arms form a 90-degree angle and then pushing back up.

    Shoulder Press: Hold dumbbells at shoulder height and press them overhead, extending your arms fully. Complete 3 sets of 10 reps, maintaining proper form and control throughout.

    Hammer Curls: Switch up your grip by performing hammer curls, keeping your palms facing each other throughout the movement. Complete 3 sets of 12 reps to target the brachialis and forearms.

    Lateral Raises: Grab a lighter pair of dumbbells and perform lateral raises to target the deltoid muscles. Complete 3 sets of 12 reps, lifting the weights out to the sides while keeping a slight bend in your elbows.

    Push-Ups: Finish strong with a set of push-ups to target the chest, shoulders, and triceps. Aim for 3 sets of 10-15 reps, maintaining a straight line from head to heels and lowering your chest towards the ground with control.

Cool Down:
Take time to stretch your arms and shoulders to help prevent soreness and promote flexibility. Focus on gentle stretches like tricep stretches, shoulder stretches, and wrist stretches to relax your muscles and improve recovery.

Remember to listen to your body and adjust the weights and reps as needed to suit your fitness level. Consistency is key, so make sure to incorporate this arm workout into your routine regularly to see results and build strength over time.

#### Utilisation:
I didnt end up using the descriptions or extra information from this response as it didnt provide the information I felt I needed however this did identify the excersises I have used in the selection.

####  Prompt 2: Describe a bicep curl to someone who is just starting to work out

#### Response:
Sure! A bicep curl is a fundamental exercise for strengthening the muscles in the front of your upper arms, called the biceps. Here's a simple description of how to do a bicep curl:

    Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing forward. Your arms should be fully extended down by your sides, with the dumbbells hanging at arm's length.

    Keep your upper arms stationary and exhale as you slowly curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders, bending your elbows. Focus on keeping your elbows close to your body throughout the movement.

    As you curl the weights upward, contract your biceps and squeeze them at the top of the movement. Your palms should naturally turn slightly upward as you lift the weights.

    Inhale as you lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position in a controlled manner, resisting the urge to let them drop. Keep your wrists straight throughout the exercise.

    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, aiming for around 8 to 12 reps to start with.

Remember to start with a lighter weight to get the form right and gradually increase the weight as you get stronger. It's important to perform the exercise with proper technique to prevent injury and effectively target the bicep muscles. If you're unsure about your form, consider seeking guidance from a fitness professional.

#### Utilisation: 
This provided me with the instructions in how to do the excersise which is used in the instructions box however I only used the first four steps and none of the extra information as i felt it was unnecessary.

#### Prompt 3: Describe a tricep dip to someone who has just started working out

#### Response:
Of course! Tricep dips are a great exercise for targeting the muscles on the back of your upper arms, known as the triceps. Here's a simple description of how to do a tricep dip:

    Find a stable surface to perform the exercise on, such as a bench, chair, or even the edge of a sturdy table. Sit on the edge of the surface with your hands placed next to your hips, fingers gripping the edge, and your palms facing downwards. Your knees should be bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart.

    Slide your bottom off the edge of the surface, supporting your body weight with your arms. Walk your feet forward slightly, so your knees are bent at about a 90-degree angle. Your arms should be straight, but your elbows shouldn't be locked.

    Inhale as you slowly lower your body by bending your elbows, keeping them close to your body and pointing straight back. Lower yourself until your elbows are bent to about 90 degrees, or until you feel a stretch in your triceps.

    Exhale as you push through your palms and straighten your arms to lift your body back up to the starting position, fully extending your elbows without locking them.

    Repeat for the desired number of repetitions, aiming for around 8 to 12 reps to start with.

Remember to keep your shoulders down and back throughout the movement, and avoid shrugging or letting them hunch up towards your ears. Also, focus on engaging your core muscles to help stabilize your body throughout the exercise. If you find this version too challenging, you can modify by keeping your knees bent at a lesser angle or performing the exercise on a higher surface. As you get stronger, you can gradually increase the challenge by lowering yourself further or straightening your legs for a more advanced version.

#### Utilisation:
Like the last response I used this for the instructions for the tricep dip excersise. Again I only used the first four steps and none of the extra description as I felt it wasnt relevant.
